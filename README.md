## About TrackWork
TrackWork is a personal project originally built in the PHP-MVC Phalcon. It's designed to be a tool for keeping your work-hours logged and displayed
in a neat and tidy way. On top of that, TrackWork gives a basic analysis on the logged hours and can export a PDF-document with all the information
to whoever is in need of it (an employer, cashier etc.).  

This project is only a personal one and is not planned to be built for commercial use as of this moment. Additions and suggestions on improvement is
however well appreciated.
